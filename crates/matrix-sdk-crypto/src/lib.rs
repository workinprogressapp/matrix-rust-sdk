/// # Introduction
///
/// Welcome to the first part of this guide, where we will introduce the
/// fundamental concepts of end-to-end encryption and its implementation in
/// Matrix.
///
/// This section will provide a clear and concise overview of what
/// end-to-end encryption is and why it is important for secure communication.
/// You will also learn about how Matrix uses end-to-end encryption to protect
/// the privacy and security of its users' communications. Whether you are new
/// to the topic or simply want to improve your understanding, this section will
/// serve as a solid foundation for the rest of the guide.
///
/// Let's dive in!
///
/// ## Notation
///
/// ## End-to-end-encryption
///
/// End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication where only
/// the communicating devices, also known as "the ends," can read the data being
/// transmitted. This means that the data is encrypted on one device, and can
/// only be decrypted on the other device. The server is used only as a
/// transport mechanism to deliver messages between devices.
///
/// The following chart displays how communication between two clients using a
/// server in the middle usually works.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     bob[Bob]
///     subgraph Homeserver
///         direction LR
///         outbox[Alice outbox]
///         inbox[Bob inbox]
///         outbox -. unencrypted .-> inbox
///     end
///
///     alice -- encrypted --> outbox
///     inbox -- encrypted --> bob
/// ```
///
/// The next chart, instead, displays how the same flow is happening in a
/// end-to-end-encrypted world.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     bob[Bob]
///     subgraph Homeserver
///         direction LR
///         outbox[Alice outbox]
///         inbox[Bob inbox]
///         outbox == encrypted ==> inbox
///     end
///
///     alice == encrypted ==> outbox
///     inbox == encrypted ==> bob
/// ```
///
/// Note that the path from the outbox to the inbox is now encrypted as well.
///
/// Alice and Bob have created a secure communication channel
/// through which they can exchange messages confidentially, without the risk of
/// the server accessing the contents of their messages.
///
/// ## Publishing cryptographic identities of devices
///
/// If Alice and Bob want to establish a secure channel over which they can
/// exchange messages, they first need learn about each others cryptographic
/// identities. This is achieved by using the homeserver as a public key
/// directory.
///
/// A public key directory is used to store and distribute public keys of users
/// in an end-to-end encrypted system. The basic idea behind a public key
/// directory is that it allows users to easily discover and download the public
/// keys of other users with whom they wish to establish an end-to-end encrypted
/// communication.
///
/// Each user generates a pair of public and private keys. The user then uploads
/// their public key to the public key directory. Other users can then search
/// the directory to find the public key of the user they wish to communicate
/// with, and download it to their own device.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     subgraph homeserver[Homeserver]
///         direction LR
///         directory[(Public key directory)]
///     end
///     bob[Bob]
///
///     alice -- upload keys --> directory
///     directory -- download keys --> bob
/// ```
///
/// Once a user has the other user's public key, they can use it to establish an
/// end-to-end encrypted channel using a [key-agreement] protocol.
///
/// ## Using the Triple Diffie-Hellman key-agreement protocol
///
/// In X3DH, each user generates a long-term identity key pair and a set of
/// one-time prekeys. When two users want to establish a shared secret key, they
/// exchange their public identity keys and one of their prekeys. These public
/// keys are then used in a [Diffie-Hellman] key exchange to compute a shared
/// secret key.
///
/// The use of one-time prekeys ensures that the shared secret key is different
/// for each session, even if the same identity keys are used.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
/// subgraph alice_keys[Alice Keys]
///     direction TB
///     alice_key[Alice's identity key]
///     alice_base_key[Alice's one-time key]
/// end
///
/// subgraph bob_keys[Bob Keys]
///     direction TB
///     bob_key[Bob's identity key]
///     bob_one_time[Bob's one-time key]
/// end
///
/// alice_key <--> bob_one_time
/// alice_base_key <--> bob_one_time
/// alice_base_key <--> bob_key
/// ```
///
/// Similar to [X3DH] (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) key agreement protocol
///
/// ## Speeding up encryption for large groups
///
/// TODO Explain how megolm fits into this
///
/// # Getting started
///
/// In the [Matrix] world the server is called a [homeserver]
///
/// ## Push/pull mechanism
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     homeserver[Homeserver]
///     client[OlmMachine]
///
///     homeserver -- pull --> client
///     client -- push --> homeserver
/// ```
///
/// ## Initializing the state machine
///
/// ```
/// use anyhow::Result;
/// use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// use ruma::user_id;
///
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// let user_id = user_id!("@alice:localhost");
/// let device_id = "DEVICEID".into();
///
/// let machine = OlmMachine::new(user_id, device_id).await;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This will create a [`OlmMachine`] that does not persist any data TODO
/// ```ignore
/// use anyhow::Result;
/// use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// use matrix_sdk_sled::SledCryptoStore;
/// use ruma::user_id;
///
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// let user_id = user_id!("@alice:localhost");
/// let device_id = "DEVICEID".into();
///
/// let store = SledCryptoStore::open("/home/example/matrix-client/").await?;
///
/// let machine = OlmMachine::with_store(user_id, device_id, store).await;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Decryption
///
/// In the world of encrypted communication, it is common to start with the
/// encryption step when implementing a protocol. However, in the case of adding
/// end-to-end encryption support to a Matrix client library, a simpler approach
/// is to first focus on the decryption process. This is because there are
/// already Matrix clients in existence that support encryption, which means
/// that our client library can simply receive encrypted messages and then
/// decrypt them.
///
/// In this section, we will guide you through the minimal steps
/// necessary to get the decryption process up and running using the
/// matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate. By the end of this section you should have a
/// Matrix client that is able to decrypt room events that other clients have
/// sent.
///
/// To enable decryption the following three steps are needed:
///
/// 1. [The cryptographic identity of your device needs to be published to the
/// homeserver](#uploading-identity-and-one-time-keys).
/// 2. [Decryption keys coming in from other devices need to be processed and
/// stored](#receiving-room-keys-and-related-changes).
/// 3. [Individual messages need to be decrypted](#decrypting-room-events).
///
/// The simplified flowchart
/// ```mermaid
/// graph TD
///     sync[Sync with the homeserver]
///     receive_changes[Push E2EE related changes into the state machine]
///     send_outgoing_requests[Send all outgoing requests to the homeserver]
///     decrypt[Process the rest of the sync]
///
///     sync --> receive_changes;
///     receive_changes --> send_outgoing_requests;
///     send_outgoing_requests --> decrypt;
///     decrypt -- repeat --> sync;
/// ```
///
/// ## Uploading identity and one-time keys.
///
/// To enable end-to-end encryption in a Matrix client, the first step is to
/// announce the support for it to other users in the network. This is done by
/// publishing the client's long-term device keys and a set of one-time prekeys
/// to the Matrix homeserver. The homeserver then makes this information
/// available to other devices in the network.
///
/// The long-term device keys and one-time prekeys allow other devices to
/// encrypt messages specifically for your device.
///
/// To achieve this, you will need to extract any requests that need to be sent
/// to the homeserver from the [`OlmMachine`] and send them to the homeserver.
/// The following snippet showcases how to achieve this using the
/// [`OlmMachine::outgoing_requests()`] method:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use ruma::api::client::keys::upload_keys::v3::Response;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::{OlmMachine, OutgoingRequest};
/// # async fn send_request(request: OutgoingRequest) -> Result<Response> {
/// #     let response = unimplemented!();
/// #     Ok(response)
/// # }
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let machine: OlmMachine = unimplemented!();
/// // Get all the outgoing requests.
/// let outgoing_requests = machine.outgoing_requests().await?;
///
/// // Send each request to the server and push the response into the state machine.
/// // You can safely send these requests out in parallel.
/// for request in outgoing_requests {
///     let request_id = request.request_id();
///     // Send the request to the server and await a response.
///     let response = send_request(request).await?;
///     // Push the response into the state machine.
///     machine.mark_request_as_sent(&request_id, &response).await?;
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// It's important to note that the outgoing requests method in the
/// [`OlmMachine`], while thread-safe, may return the same request multiple
/// times if it is called multiple times before the request has been marked as
/// sent. To prevent this issue, it is advisable to encapsulate the outgoing
/// request handling logic into a separate helper method and protect it from
/// being called multiple times concurrently using a lock.
///
/// This helps to ensure that the request is only handled once and prevents
/// multiple identical requests from being sent.
///
/// Additionally, if an error occurs while sending a request using the
/// [`OlmMachine::outgoing_requests()`] method, the request will be
/// naturally retried the next time the method is called.
///
/// A more complete example, which uses a helper method, might look like this:
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use ruma::api::client::keys::upload_keys::v3::Response;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::{OlmMachine, OutgoingRequest};
/// # async fn send_request(request: &OutgoingRequest) -> Result<Response> {
/// #     let response = unimplemented!();
/// #     Ok(response)
/// # }
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// struct Client {
///     outgoing_requests_lock: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>,
///     olm_machine: OlmMachine,
/// }
///
/// async fn process_outgoing_requests(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
///     // Let's acquire a lock so we know that we don't send out the same request out multiple
///     // times.
///     let guard = client.outgoing_requests_lock.lock().await;
///
///     for request in client.olm_machine.outgoing_requests().await? {
///         let request_id = request.request_id();
///
///         match send_request(&request).await {
///             Ok(response) => {
///                 client.olm_machine.mark_request_as_sent(&request_id, &response).await?;
///             }
///             Err(error) => {
///                 // It's OK to ignore transient HTTP errors since requests will be retried.
///                 eprintln!(
///                     "Error while sending out a end-to-end encryption \
///                     related request: {error:?}"
///                 );
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Once we have the helper method that processes our outgoing requests we can
/// structure our sync method as follows:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # struct Client {
/// #     outgoing_requests_lock: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>,
/// #     olm_machine: OlmMachine,
/// # }
/// # async fn process_outgoing_requests(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
/// #    unimplemented!();
/// # }
/// # async fn send_out_sync_request(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
/// #    unimplemented!();
/// # }
/// async fn sync(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
///     // This is happening at the top of the method so we advertise our
///     // end-to-end encryption capabilities as soon as possible.
///     process_outgoing_requests(client).await?;
///
///     // We can sync with the homeserver now.
///     let response = send_out_sync_request(client).await?;
///
///     // Process the sync response here.
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Receiving room keys and related changes
///
/// The next step in our implementation is to forward messages that were sent
/// directly to the client's device, and state updates about the one-time
/// prekeys, to the [`OlmMachine`]. This is achieved using
/// the [`OlmMachine::receive_sync_changes()`] method.
///
/// The method performs two tasks:
///
/// 1. It processes and, if necessary, decrypts each [to-device] event that was
/// pushed into it, and returns the decrypted events. The original events are
/// replaced with their decrypted versions.
///
/// 2. It produces internal state changes that may trigger the creation of new
/// outgoing requests. For example, if the server informs the client that its
/// one-time prekeys have been depleted, the OlmMachine will create an outgoing
/// request to replenish them.
///
/// Our updated sync method now looks like this:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// # use ruma::api::client::sync::sync_events::v3::Response;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # struct Client {
/// #     outgoing_requests_lock: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>,
/// #     olm_machine: OlmMachine,
/// # }
/// # async fn process_outgoing_requests(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
/// #    unimplemented!();
/// # }
/// # async fn send_out_sync_request(client: &Client) -> Result<Response> {
/// #    unimplemented!();
/// # }
/// async fn sync(client: &Client) -> Result<()> {
///     process_outgoing_requests(client).await?;
///
///     let response = send_out_sync_request(client).await?;
///
///     // Push the sync changes into the OlmMachine, make sure that this is
///     // happening before the `next_batch` token of the sync is persisted.
///     let to_device_events = client
///         .olm_machine
///         .receive_sync_changes(
///             response.to_device.events,
///             &response.device_lists,
///             &response.device_one_time_keys_count,
///             response.device_unused_fallback_key_types.as_deref(),
///         )
///         .await?;
///
///     // Send out the outgoing requests that receiving sync changes produced.
///     process_outgoing_requests(client).await?;
///
///     // Process the rest of the sync response here.
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// It is important to note that the names of the fields in the response shown
/// in the example match the names of the fields specified in the [sync]
/// response specification.
///
/// It is critical to note that due to the ephemeral nature of to-device
/// events[[1]](https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#server-behaviour-4),
/// it is important to process these events before persisting the `next_batch`
/// sync token. This is because if the `next_batch` sync token is persisted
/// before processing the to-device events, some messages might be lost, leading
/// to decryption failures.
///
/// ## Decrypting room events
///
/// The final step in the decryption process is to decrypt the room events that
/// are received from the server. To do this, the encrypted events must be
/// passed to the [`OlmMachine`], which will use the keys that were previously
/// exchanged between devices to decrypt the events. The decrypted events can
/// then be processed and displayed to the user in the Matrix client.
///
/// Room message [events] can be decrypted using the
/// [`OlmMachine::decrypt_room_event()`] method:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let encrypted = unimplemented!();
/// # let room_id = unimplemented!();
/// # let machine: OlmMachine = unimplemented!();
/// // Decrypt your room events now.
/// let decrypted = machine.decrypt_room_event(encrypted, room_id).await?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// It's worth mentioning that the [`OlmMachine::decrypt_room_event()`] method
/// is designed to be thread-safe and can be safely called concurrently. This
/// means that room message [events] can be processed in parallel, improving the
/// overall efficiency of the end-to-end encryption implementation.
///
/// By allowing room message [events] to be processed concurrently, the client's
/// implementation can take full advantage of the capabilities of modern
/// hardware and achieve better performance, especially when dealing with a
/// large number of messages at once.
